Got it! Let’s update the Confluence page to use a more detailed ADR template that includes options and their associated pros and cons. Here's the revised draft:

Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Guidelines

What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) documents architectural decisions made within a project, including the options considered, their pros and cons, and the final decision. ADRs help teams maintain a history of decisions for clarity and alignment over time.

For more details on ADRs, refer to Documenting Architecture Decisions by Michael Nygard.

Naming Conventions for ADRs

Each ADR should follow this naming convention:

ADR### - Short Title of the Decision

###: Incremental number starting from 001.

Short Title: Briefly describes the decision. Example:

ADR001 - Use an SQS Queue to Manage Mail

ADR002 - Choose PostgreSQL as the Database

ADR Template with Options

Here’s the template we will follow for ADRs:

1. Title

A clear and concise name for the decision.


2. Status

Current status of the ADR: Proposed, Accepted, Superseded, or Deprecated.


3. Context

What is the problem? Provide background information and the factors leading to this decision.

Why is this decision needed now? Explain the urgency or importance.


4. Options Considered

List the options evaluated, with their pros and cons. For each option:

Option 1: [Option Name]

Description: Brief explanation of the option.

Pros:

Advantage 1

Advantage 2


Cons:

Disadvantage 1

Disadvantage 2



Option 2: [Option Name]

Description: Brief explanation of the option.

Pros:

Advantage 1

Advantage 2


Cons:

Disadvantage 1

Disadvantage 2



(Repeat for all options considered.)

5. Decision

State the chosen option and provide a detailed explanation of why it was selected.


6. Consequences

List the implications of this decision, including any follow-up tasks, risks, or long-term impacts.


7. See Also

Link related ADRs or relevant documentation for reference.

How to Create and Submit ADRs

1. Draft the ADR:

Use the template above to structure your ADR.

Include all options, pros/cons, and reasoning.



2. Submit a Pull Request:

Create a branch named feature/adr###-short-title.

Add the ADR file to the /adr folder in the repository.

Include any diagrams (use PlantUML if needed) in the /adr folder.



3. Review Process:

Open a Pull Request (PR) titled ADR### - Short Title.

Collaborate with the team to review and finalize the decision.



4. Merge:

After team approval, merge the PR into the main branch.

Where to Store ADRs

All ADRs should be stored in the adr folder of the project repository:

/project-root/adr/

This ensures they are version-controlled and accessible.

Example ADR

ADR001 - Use an SQS Queue to Manage Mail

1. Status: Accepted


2. Context: We need to handle a large volume of email notifications reliably and asynchronously.


3. Options Considered:

Option 1: Use an SQS Queue

Pros: Scalable, reliable, integrates well with AWS Lambda.

Cons: Requires additional setup and monitoring.


Option 2: Direct Database Writes

Pros: Simpler implementation.

Cons: Less scalable, may lead to bottlenecks during peak load.




4. Decision: Use an SQS queue because it ensures scalability and reliability for high-volume email notifications.


5. Consequences: Set up SQS and integrate with the notification service. Monitor for errors or delays.

By following these guidelines, we ensure all architectural decisions are well-documented, consistent, and collaborative.
