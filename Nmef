Subject: Quick Discussion: Birdwatcher Stats and Position Controls

Hi [Architect's Name] and [Team Leader's Name],

I wanted to bring up a few points we should discuss about improving how we handle Birdwatcher stats. We can do this over email/chat if we can cover everything, or hop on a quick call if needed.

The main idea is to start getting Birdwatcher stats from the Metadata API instead of Airflow. This would give us the flexibility to monitor ad-hoc jobs if needed. The key question is: what metrics can we enrich from RiskEngine so we still have all the measures we rely on today?

Here are the most important controls we use right now:

1. Position control (mostly from Vault and RiskEngine).


2. Risk factors (from RiskEngine).


3. Vault data (we already get this from Vault Solace notifications in Metadata).



Another point is to start using the Report Server for position controls and detailed positions, which we currently pull from the Context Store.

Let me know your thoughts! If it’s easier to talk it through, I’m happy to schedule a quick call.

Cheers,
[Your Name]
